            <h3>Goldilocks and the Three Bears ~ Bedtime Stories for Kids</h3>
            <p>Once upon a time a girl named Goldilocks lived in a house at the edge of the woods. In those days curls of hair were called "locks."  She was "Goldilocks" because golden hair ran down her head and shoulders.   

             One morning Goldilocks was out for a walk when she came across a beautiful bird.  She followed that bird right into the woods, where her mother had said many times she must never go.  But Goldilocks didnâ€™t think of that.
